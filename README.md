*In this project, after I created my data, I migrated my data to Sql Server. For web page design, I worked on the master page with the help of bootstrap and bootswatch. I created a partial view for pop-up notifications and used it on the master page. I used the validation partial view in the desired views. Then I completed the CRUD operations on the controller.*
